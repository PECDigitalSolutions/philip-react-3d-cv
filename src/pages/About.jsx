      <p>
        Hi! My name is Philip Eriksson, and I am a curious and driven software developer with several years of experience in system development, 
        Master Data Management (MDM), .NET, and React.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thrive when I can combine technology with problem-solving and collaborate in teams with diverse backgrounds. My focus is always on delivering clean, well-tested solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I am building this website as both a portfolio and a playground to experiment with modern web development â€“ React, 3D, and other exciting technologies!
      </p>
